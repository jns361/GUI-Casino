### Learning Project

A simple WPF Casino App with two game modes:
- **Roulette**
- **Poker**

Both modes share the same chip balance, and the visuals are based on pixel-style sprites.

This was built as a first bigger than 100 lines learning project. I started with a few buttons to play around with and 'exploring' WPF for the first time but ended up with a ~3000 lines project :D  
I'm aware the code most likely isn't the best and well written, but it works and I have learned a lot :D

## 🧠 About this project

I started this to get into GUI programming with WPF – originally planned as a small experiment, but I ended up learning a lot about:
- Event handling
- State management
- Game logic
- UI feedback
- and obviously debugging ^^
